# Querying-in-SQL-Coursework
This was a coursework where we had to use SQL queries to filter data in extremely huge datasets. In this coursework we are querying through IMDBs database subset.

## Using the SQL code
To be able to run the queries uploaded here, you will need to download the IMDB database subset, which is  attached above as a zip file and load it on to your own MariaDB/mySQL. 

## Questions in SQL file
The questions used to query are listed below in order:
|Question| |
|:----|:----|
|1|How many female actors are listed in the dataset supplied?|
|2|What is the length of the longest running film?|
|3|How many comedy films has Harrison Ford been in?|
|4|What is the surname/family name of the writer who has written the most movies?|
|5|What is the total running time of all the Sci-Fi movies in the dataset?|
|6|How many movies star both ‘Ewan McGregor’ and ‘Robert Carlyle’?(i.e. both actors are starring in the same movie)|
|7|How many actors (male / female) have worked together on 10 or more films?|
|8|Assign the number of movies released per decade as listed (1960-69, 1970-79, 1980-89,1990-99,2000-2009)|
|9|How many movies have more female actors than male actors?|
|10|Based on ratings with 10,000 or more votes, what is the top movie genre using the average rank per movie genre as the metric?(Note: where a higher value for rank is considered a better movie)11|List any actors (male/female) that have starred in 10 or more different film genres.12|How many movies have an actor/actress that also wrote and directed the movie?|
|13|Which decade has the highest average ranked movies?(put the first year from the decade, so for 1900-1909 you would put 1900)14|How many movies are missing a genre in the dataset?|
|15|How many movies have an actor/actress written and directed but not starred in?  (i.e. the person that wrote and directed the movie is an actor/actress but they didn't star in their own movie)|
